<h2 align="center">DHCP = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h2>

<h5>Purpose:</h5>

DHCP learn to devices much more than just the IP address to use.
DHCP is used to allow hosts to automatically/dynamically learn various aspects
of their configuration, such as IP addresses, subnet mask, default getaway,
DNS server, etc... Without manual/static configuration.

It's an essential part of modern Networks. For example, when you connect a
phone/laptop to WiFi, do you ask the network admin which IP address, subnet mask,
default getaway, etc, for the device to use? Don't think so, even if it could be
done, but would be unpractical in large networks or other type of environments.

DHCP is typically used for 'client devices' such as phones, workstations, etc..
Devices such as routers, servers, etc.. are usually manually configured. This is
as well that these types of devices do need a fixed IP to perform their functions.

Imagine if the network getaway kept changing its IP, the network would be affected.

In small networks or home networks, the router typically acts as the DHCP server
for hosts in the LAN.

In larger Networks, the DHCP server is usually a Windows/Linux server.
