<h2 align="center">LAN Architecture</h2>

There are standard 'best practices' for networking design, however there are few universal 'correct answers'. \
The answer to most general questions about network design is: "it depends". This is because it indeed
depends on the client needs and requirements.

Let's go over some common terminology to prepare for the chapter, not only for LAN design, but for network in general:

- <b>STAR</b> topology: When several devices all connect to one central device we can draw them in a 'star' shape like below, si this is often called a 'star topology'.
