<h4 align="center">What is DHCP Snooping</h4>

DHCP snooping is a security feature of switches that is used to filter DHCP messages
received on _untrusted_ ports.
DHCP snooping only filters DHCP messages, non DHCP messages aren't affected.
All ports are _untrusted_ by default. Usually <strong>uplink</strong> ports are
configured as _trusted_ ports, and <strong>downlink</strong> ports remain _untrusted_.
