# My CCNA Notes


Hi everyone, 

Here I'll keep track of my CCNA studies. I'm going to upload here all my personal notes to share in case you are thinkingor studying for the CCNA certification.

I'm doing this to help me study by re explaining, hopefully, if it makes sense, it will mean that I understood the subject :)

If you want to follow along please do install wireshark, it will make it easier to understand what I talk about.
